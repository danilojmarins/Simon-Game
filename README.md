# Simon (Genius) Game

## This project is a Simon (Genius) Game made with jQuery library.

Simon Game, also known as Genius Game, is a classic toy of memory skill that was very popular back in the 80's.
This online version simulates basically the same functionalities of a physical one.

How it works: every new round a random square, out of 4, each one with a different color, will blink and produce a sound. Your job is to click on the squares in the same sequence as it is showed, every round since the begning of the sequence. It's a great game to improve your memory.

This project was proposed during the "Boss Level Challenge 2" module of the course: "[The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)".
